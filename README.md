## Summary
One drawback to this webpage is the need to type in the entire word or phrase exactly as it shows up in the table in order to get results. 
Example: In the first image, you can see that typing in "gra" brings up no results, but by typing in "grants pass", you get results.

I would recommend updating the filter to show results for partial matches and consider changing the date filter to a range of dates instead of a singular date in order to return more results.
